# Project: Heart Disease Detection

Description
-----------
Example project for data analysis and modeling focused on heart disease detection using the `heart.csv` dataset and a Jupyter notebook (`heart_desease.ipynb`).  
The main goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, training, and evaluation of classification models to predict the presence of heart disease.

Minimum notebook content
------------------------
- Load and overview of `heart.csv`.
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
- Exploratory analysis (visualizations and correlations).
- Data preparation (scaling, encoding, train/test split).
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and classification metrics.
